# 8.03 Other Frameworks (Astro, Remix, Gatsby, TanStack, Nuxt)

Beyond Next.js, there are several other modern frameworks
that solve **rendering, data fetching, and routing**
in different ways.

Each framework makes **different trade-offs**.

This section gives a **high-level understanding**
of the most common ones.

---

## Why so many frameworks exist

All frontend frameworks try to answer:

- Where is HTML generated?
- Where does data fetching happen?
- How much JavaScript is sent to the browser?
- How do we balance performance and developer experience?

Different teams value **different priorities**:

- performance
- simplicity
- server control
- flexibility
- static output

That’s why multiple frameworks coexist.

---

## Astro

### What Astro is

Astro is a **content-first framework** focused on:

- extremely fast static sites
- minimal JavaScript by default
- excellent performance

Astro’s core idea:

> “Ship HTML by default.  
> Add JavaScript only when needed.”

---

### Key characteristics

- **SSG-first**
- zero JavaScript by default
- supports multiple frameworks:
  - React
  - Vue
  - Svelte
  - Solid
- hydration is **opt-in per component**

Example idea:

```astro
<MyReactComponent client:load />
```

If you don’t opt in → no JS is shipped.

---

### When Astro is a good fit

- blogs
- documentation
- marketing sites
- content-heavy pages
- performance-critical public sites

Astro is **not ideal** for highly interactive apps.

---

## Remix

### What Remix is

Remix is a **server-first React framework**.

It focuses on:

- web standards
- forms and navigation
- server-side data handling

Remix philosophy:

> “Let the server do the work.”

---

### Key characteristics

- SSR by default
- strong focus on:
  - forms
  - mutations
  - loaders and actions

- minimal client-side state
- progressive enhancement built in

Data fetching is tied to routes:

```ts
export async function loader() {}
export async function action() {}
```

---

### When Remix is a good fit

- form-heavy apps
- data-driven apps
- apps with lots of mutations
- teams that like backend-style control

Remix feels closer to **classic web apps**, but modern.

---

## Gatsby

### What Gatsby is

Gatsby is a **static-site-focused React framework**.

It was one of the first popular SSG frameworks.

---

### Key characteristics

- SSG-first
- GraphQL-based data layer
- strong plugin ecosystem
- heavy build-time processing

---

### Strengths and limitations

Pros:

- great for content sites
- large plugin ecosystem
- good SEO support

Cons:

- complex build process
- GraphQL overhead
- slower builds on large sites
- less flexible than modern alternatives

Gatsby is **less popular today**, but still exists in many codebases.

---

## TanStack (Router + Query)

### What TanStack is

TanStack is **not a full framework**.

It provides **powerful building blocks**:

- TanStack Query → data fetching & caching
- TanStack Router → type-safe routing
- TanStack Table → complex tables

You combine them with:

- React
- Vite
- your own server setup

---

### Key idea

TanStack focuses on **client-side architecture**:

- caching
- synchronising server state
- type safety

It does **not** decide rendering strategy for you.

---

### When TanStack is a good fit

- SPAs (Single Page Application)
- dashboards
- data-heavy client apps
- apps with complex server state

Often used with **CSR or SSR frameworks**.

---

## Nuxt (Vue equivalent of Next.js)

### What Nuxt is

Nuxt is a **Vue framework** similar to Next.js.

It provides:

- SSR
- SSG
- ISR-like behaviour
- file-based routing

But for **Vue instead of React**.

---

### Key characteristics

- Vue-based
- server-first by default
- strong conventions
- built-in data fetching

Nuxt is popular in the Vue ecosystem.

---

## Quick comparison

| Framework | Main focus                 |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Next.js   | Flexible SSR / SSG / ISR   |
| Astro     | Static HTML + minimal JS   |
| Remix     | Server-first web apps      |
| Gatsby    | SSG with heavy tooling     |
| TanStack  | Client-side data & routing |
| Nuxt      | Next.js for Vue            |

---

## How to choose

Ask yourself:

- Mostly static content? → **Astro**
- Dynamic React app? → **Next.js**
- Form-heavy, server-driven app? → **Remix**
- SPA with heavy data needs? → **TanStack**
- Vue project? → **Nuxt**
- Legacy SSG React project? → **Gatsby**

---

## Mental model

- Next.js → flexible all-rounder
- Astro → HTML-first, JS-last
- Remix → server does the work
- Gatsby → build-time heavy SSG
- TanStack → client-state powerhouse
- Nuxt → Vue SSR framework

---

## Summary

- Multiple frameworks exist for different priorities
- Next.js is the most general-purpose for React
- Astro is best for static, content-heavy sites
- Remix is server-first and form-friendly
- Gatsby is older but still present
- TanStack provides tools, not opinions
- Nuxt is the Vue alternative to Next.js
- Choose based on **content, interactivity, and control**, not trends
