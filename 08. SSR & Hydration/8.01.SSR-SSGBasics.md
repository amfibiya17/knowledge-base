# 8.01 SSR & SSG Basics

SSR and SSG describe **how and when HTML is generated**
for a web application.

They solve the question:

> “When does the server create the page HTML -  
> before the request, or at request time?”

Understanding this is essential for **performance, SEO, and UX**.

## The three rendering models (big picture)

In modern web apps, HTML can be generated in three main ways:

- **CSR** - Client-Side Rendering
- **SSR** - Server-Side Rendering
- **SSG** - Static Site Generation

This section focuses on **SSR and SSG**.

---

## What Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is

**SSR** means:

- HTML is generated **on the server**
- **for every request**
- and sent to the browser fully formed

Flow:

1. User requests a page
2. Server runs React code
3. Server returns HTML
4. Browser displays content immediately
5. React hydrates on the client

Example idea:

```text
Request → Server → HTML → Browser → Hydration
```

---

## Key characteristics of SSR

SSR pages:

- are rendered **per request**
- can use request-specific data
- always return fresh content
- cost more server resources

SSR is useful when:

- content changes often
- data depends on the user
- SEO is important
- first load must show real content

---

## What Static Site Generation (SSG) is

**SSG** means:

- HTML is generated **at build time**
- before users visit the site
- and served as static files

Flow:

1. Build step runs React
2. HTML files are generated
3. Files are deployed to CDN (Content Delivery Network)
4. Browser downloads static HTML
5. React hydrates on the client

Example idea:

```text
Build → HTML files → CDN → Browser → Hydration
```

---

## Key characteristics of SSG

SSG pages:

- are generated **once**
- served instantly from CDN
- extremely fast
- very cheap to host

SSG is ideal for:

- marketing pages
- blogs
- documentation
- content that changes rarely

---

## SSR vs SSG (core difference)

**SSR**

- render time: request-time
- content: always fresh
- server load: higher
- flexibility: high

**SSG**

- render time: build-time
- content: fixed until rebuild
- server load: minimal
- performance: excellent

---

## Why SSR & SSG exist

They solve problems with **pure client-side rendering**:

CSR problems:

- blank page while JS loads
- poor SEO
- slow first contentful paint
- bad experience on slow devices

SSR / SSG improve:

- perceived performance
- SEO
- accessibility
- initial load experience

---

## Hydration

Both SSR and SSG use **hydration**.

Hydration means:

- HTML is already on the page
- React attaches event handlers
- the app becomes interactive

HTML comes from the server or build,
but **interactivity comes from the client**.

---

## SSR & SSG are not opposites

Most real apps use **both**:

- SSG for static pages
- SSR for dynamic or personalised pages

Example:

- Homepage → SSG
- Blog posts → SSG
- Dashboard → SSR
- Account page → SSR

---

## When NOT to use SSR or SSG

SSR / SSG may be unnecessary when:

- SEO does not matter
- app is behind login
- content is fully client-driven
- performance is acceptable with CSR

CSR is still valid in many cases.

---

## Mental model

- **SSR** → HTML per request (the server prepares fresh HTML)
- **SSG** → HTML at build time (the server prepares HTML once, users just download it)
- **Hydration** → React attaches behaviour (React makes buttons clickable, forms work, menus open)
- **Client** → handles interaction (clicks, typing, animations, state changes)

Ask:

> “Do I need fresh HTML every request,
> or can I reuse prebuilt HTML?”

---

## Summary

- SSR renders HTML on the server per request
- SSG renders HTML at build time
- Both send HTML before JavaScript runs
- Both use hydration for interactivity
- SSR = flexibility
- SSG = speed and simplicity
- Most apps use a mix of both
