# 7.08 AI

AI tools are increasingly used to **support developers**, not replace them.
They help with **speed, learning, and quality**, but still require
**human judgement and responsibility**.

AI is a **tool**, not an authority.

---

## What “AI” means in this context

In frontend development, AI usually refers to:

- code assistants (LLMs)
- automated suggestions
- pattern recognition
- content generation
- test and refactor helpers

Examples of AI tools developers use:

- ChatGPT / GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Codeium
- IDE AI assistants
- AI-powered linters and reviewers

---

## What AI is good at

AI works best at **repetitive and pattern-based tasks**.

Common good use cases:

### Code assistance

- writing boilerplate
- generating components
- suggesting hooks usage
- explaining unfamiliar code
- converting patterns (e.g. JS → TS)

AI is especially helpful when:

- starting from scratch
- exploring an unfamiliar API
- prototyping quickly

---

### Learning & explanation

AI is very good at:

- explaining concepts in simpler terms
- comparing approaches
- answering “why” questions
- giving examples

This makes it useful for:

- juniors learning
- understanding legacy code
- refreshing fundamentals

---

### Refactoring & cleanup

AI can help with:

- renaming variables
- extracting functions
- simplifying logic
- identifying duplication
- suggesting structure improvements

But developer still decides **what is correct**.

---

### Testing & documentation

AI can assist with:

- generating unit test skeletons
- suggesting test cases
- writing README drafts
- documenting components or APIs

This speeds up work,
but generated content must be **reviewed**.

---

## When AI is most useful

AI shines when:

- you already understand the basics
- you can evaluate output critically
- you use it to accelerate known patterns
- you treat it as a pair-programmer

Best mindset:

> “AI suggests. I decide.”

---

## When to be careful

Be extra cautious when using AI for:

- authentication / security
- payments
- accessibility logic
- performance-critical code
- complex state management

Always verify with:

- documentation
- tests
- manual reasoning

---

## Ethical & practical considerations

Things to be aware of:

- licensing of generated code
- privacy of shared code
- company policies on AI usage
- over-reliance on external tools

Many companies define **rules** for AI usage.

---

## Mental model

- AI → accelerator
- Developer → decision-maker
- Responsibility → always human

Think:

> “Would I be able to explain this code in an interview?”

If not — don’t ship it (!)

---

## Summary

- AI is a powerful development assistant
- Great for boilerplate, learning, and speed
- Not reliable for complex or critical logic
- Can produce incorrect or suboptimal code
- Requires strong fundamentals to use safely
