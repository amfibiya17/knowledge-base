# 7.07 Code Generation & Scaffolding

**Code generation and scaffolding** are techniques used to
**automatically create boilerplate code** instead of writing it by hand.

They help teams:

- move faster
- stay consistent
- avoid repetitive work
- reduce human error

This is about **automation**, not magic.

---

## What scaffolding is

**Scaffolding** means:

> generating a basic structure that you then build on

Examples:

- a new component folder
- a page with routing already set up
- a feature with tests, styles, and types
- a hook with a standard pattern

Instead of starting from a blank file, you start from a **template**.

---

## What code generation is

**Code generation** is broader than scaffolding.

It includes:

- generating code from templates
- generating types from APIs
- generating clients from schemas
- generating repetitive files programmatically

Scaffolding is usually **manual-triggered**.
Code generation is often **automatic**.

---

## Why code generation exists

Large projects suffer from:

- repeated patterns
- inconsistent structure
- forgotten files (tests, styles, exports)
- slow onboarding

Code generation solves this by enforcing:

- conventions
- structure
- best practices

Once defined, everyone follows the same rules.

---

## Common scaffolding examples

Typical generated things:

- React components
- pages / routes
- hooks
- Redux slices / stores
- API modules
- test files
- Storybook stories

Example structure:

```text
Button/
├─ Button.tsx
├─ Button.module.css
├─ Button.test.tsx
├─ Button.stories.tsx
└─ index.ts
```

Scaffolding creates this instantly.

---

## Common tools for scaffolding

### CLI-based tools

- **Plop**
- **Hygen**
- **Yeoman**
- custom scripts

These tools use templates and prompts.

Example:

```text
? Component name: Button
? Include tests? Yes
? Include styles? Yes
```

---

### Framework-built scaffolding

Many frameworks include scaffolding:

- `create-react-app`
- `create-next-app`
- `ng generate component`
- `vue create`

These generate **project-level structure**.

---

## Code generation from schemas

A very common modern use case:

### API → types → client

Examples:

- OpenAPI → TypeScript types
- GraphQL schema → queries + types
- CMS schema → typed models

Why this matters:

- frontend and backend stay in sync
- fewer runtime bugs
- better autocomplete
- safer refactors

This is **real-world code generation**, not theoretical.

---

## When code generation is a good idea

Use code generation when:

- patterns repeat often
- consistency matters
- onboarding new developers
- large or long-lived projects
- API contracts are strict

---

## Best practices

- keep templates simple
- generate only what you actually use
- review and update generators regularly
- document how to use them
- allow manual overrides when needed

Scaffolding should help developers, not constrain them.

---

## Mental model

- Scaffolding → starting point
- Code generation → automation
- Templates → shared conventions
- Humans → still responsible for logic

Think:

> “What do we write again and again?”

If the answer is “a lot” → automate it.

---

## Summary

- Scaffolding generates project structure
- Code generation automates repetitive code
- Improves consistency and speed
- Common in large teams and mature projects
- Especially useful for API types and clients
- Adds value when patterns are stable
- Should simplify work, not complicate it
