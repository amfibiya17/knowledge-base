# 7.10 Code Reviews

Code reviews are a **core engineering practice**, not a formality.

Done well, they:

- improve code quality
- reduce bugs
- spread knowledge across the team
- increase long-term team velocity

Done badly, they:

- slow teams down
- block progress
- create frustration and resentment

The goal of a code review is **better outcomes**, not perfect code.

## What a code review is (and is not)

A good code review **is**:

- collaboration
- a safety net
- a learning opportunity
- a quality checkpoint

A code review is **not**:

- a performance review
- a place to show superiority
- a “gotcha” exercise
- a chance to rewrite everything in your style

> Perfect code that ships late  
> is worse than good code that ships today.

---

## Why code reviews matter so much

Code reviews are a **force multiplier**:

- multiple people understand the code
- bugs are caught before production (!)
- standards stay consistent
- junior engineers learn faster
- senior engineers avoid being single points of failure

High-velocity teams take code reviews seriously.

## A practical framework for reviewing code

### 1. Start with a quick scan (zoom out first)

Before reading line by line, check:

- Is the **PR title and description clear**?
- Does it explain _what_ and _why_?
- Is the PR focused on **one thing**?
- Is the size reasonable?

If the PR is trying to do **five things at once**, stop and ask for it to be split.

---

### Commit messages

Commit messages should be:

- descriptive
- consistent
- meaningful in history

**Conventional Commits** are a common standard:

- `feat:` → new feature
- `fix:` → bug fix
- `chore:` → refactor / tooling / cleanup

They make:

- history easier to read
- rollbacks safer
- releases clearer

---

### 2. Check structure and readability

Ask yourself:

- Can I skim this and understand it?
- Is the flow logical?
- Are there comments where intent isn’t obvious?

If you can’t understand the change top-to-bottom:

- the PR might be too large
- naming may be unclear
- important context may be missing

Every **“I’m confused”** moment is a future bug.

---

### 3. Look at naming

Names matter because they affect **every future reader**.

Watch for:

- placeholder names left in by accident
- names that don’t match the domain
- names that force you to read implementation details

Not every naming issue is blocking, but:

- placeholder or misleading names often should be
- especially in shared or core code

---

### 4. Be extra careful with third-party integrations

When code interacts with **external systems**, scrutiny should increase.

Examples:

- APIs
- authentication
- payments
- analytics
- notifications
- SDKs

Check for:

- proper error handling
- retries (and whether they’re safe)
- timeouts
- logging
- idempotency

Many serious bugs come from **integration edges**, not local logic.

---

### 5. Ask “Is this the best approach?”

If you see:

- a simpler solution
- a standard library function
- an established pattern
- a reliable open-source tool

Suggest it, but don’t weaponise it.

Guidelines:

- suggestions ≠ blocking by default
- explain _why_ it might help
- accept that shipping matters too

Not every PR needs to be elegant.
It needs to be **correct, maintainable, and shippable**.

---

### 6. The golden rule: be kind and professional

A good review:

- critiques the **code**, not the person
- assumes positive intent
- is written for humans, not machines

Avoid:

- sarcasm
- belittling language
- “obvious” comments
- rewriting the PR in your personal style

Tone matters more than most people realise.

---

## Speed matters

Slow code reviews:

- block progress
- kill momentum
- increase context switching
- frustrate teammates

Best practices:

- review PRs daily
- respond quickly, even if partially
- keep feedback focused
- avoid bikeshedding

Fast feedback beats perfect feedback.

---

## Code reviews and team culture

Good code reviews create:

- psychological safety
- shared ownership
- consistent standards
- faster onboarding

Bad code reviews create:

- fear of shipping
- defensive behaviour
- knowledge silos

Code reviews shape **how your team feels about writing code**.

---

## Mental model

- Code review → collaboration
- Reviewer → guardrail, not gatekeeper
- Comments → help future readers
- Speed + quality → not opposites

---

## Summary

- Code reviews are a critical engineering practice
- They improve quality, learning, and velocity
- Start with structure before details
- Be extra careful with external integrations
- Balance correctness with pragmatism
- Speed and kindness matter
- Great code reviews build great teams
