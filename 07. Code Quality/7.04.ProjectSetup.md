# 7.04 Project Setup

**Project setup** is about creating a foundation that is:

- predictable
- maintainable
- scalable
- friendly for teams

A good setup reduces bugs, speeds up development,
and prevents chaos as the project grows.

---

## What “project setup” includes

Project setup usually covers:

- folder structure
- tooling configuration
- scripts
- conventions
- environment setup

It answers questions like:

- Where does code live?
- How do we run the app?
- How do we format code?
- How do we catch errors early?

---

## Folder structure (important)

There is no single “correct” structure,
but **consistency matters more than perfection**.

A common React structure:

```text
src/
  components/
  pages/
  hooks/
  utils/
  services/
  styles/
  types/
```

General rules:

- group related things together
- avoid deep nesting
- make imports predictable

Rule of thumb:

> If you have to think where a file should go, the structure is unclear.

---

## Entry points & configuration files

Typical top-level files:

```text
package.json
tsconfig.json
eslint.config.js
.prettierrc
.gitignore
.env
```

Each has a clear responsibility:

- `package.json` → scripts & dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` → TypeScript rules
- ESLint / Prettier → code quality
- `.env` → environment variables

Keep these files **clean and documented**.

---

## Scripts (developer experience)

Scripts define how developers interact with the project.

Common scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "start dev server",
    "build": "build app",
    "test": "run tests",
    "lint": "run linter",
    "format": "format code"
  }
}
```

Good scripts are:

- short
- memorable
- consistent across projects

Developers should not guess how to run things.

---

## Environment variables

Environment variables store configuration.

Secrets should never be committed to the repo.

Examples:

- API URLs
- feature flags
- build modes

Rules:

- never commit secrets
- document required variables
- provide `.env.example`

Example:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

---

## TypeScript setup (baseline)

A good TypeScript setup should:

- be strict enough to catch bugs
- not block development unnecessarily

Common recommendations:

- enable `strict`
- avoid `any`
- use path aliases if helpful

Example idea:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

TypeScript is your safety net - configure it intentionally.

---

## Linting & formatting (early, not later)

Set up **ESLint and Prettier from day one**.

Why:

- prevents style debates
- enforces best practices
- catches bugs early
- keeps code consistent

Rule:

> If formatting is automatic, no one argues about it.

---

## Git setup

Important Git-related setup:

- `.gitignore` (node_modules, build output)
- consistent branch naming
- clear commit messages

Optional but helpful:

- pre-commit hooks
- linting on commit
- tests before push

This prevents broken code from entering the repo.

---

## Aliases & imports

Import paths should be:

- short
- readable
- stable

Instead of:

```ts
import Button from "../../../components/Button";
```

Prefer:

```ts
import Button from "@/components/Button";
```

This improves readability and refactoring.

---

## Documentation

At minimum, include:

- a `README.md`
- how to run the project
- required environment variables
- basic project structure

New developers should be able to start in **minutes**, not days.

---

## Common project setup mistakes

- no clear folder structure
- mixing patterns without rules
- adding tools without understanding them
- ignoring TypeScript or lint errors
- no documentation

Bad setup slows everyone down over time.

---

## Summary

- Project setup defines how a team works
- Structure and conventions matter more than trends
- Scripts and tooling should be simple and clear
- TypeScript, linting, and formatting are essential
- Environment variables keep config out of code
- Good setup prevents long-term pain
