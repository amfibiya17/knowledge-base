# 1.4 One-Way Data Flow

## What one-way data flow means
One-way data flow means that data moves in a single direction in a React application.

Data flows:
- from **parent components**
- down to **child components**

Child components do **not** directly change the data they receive.

---

## Why one-way data flow exists
One-way data flow makes applications:
- easier to understand
- easier to debug
- more predictable

When data always moves in the same direction, it’s clearer where changes come from.

---

## Parent and child components
In React, components are often nested.

Example idea:
- A **parent component** holds data
- A **child component** receives that data

The parent:
- owns the data
- controls when it changes

The child:
- uses the data
- does not change it directly

---

## Props (passing data down)
Data is passed from parent to child using **props**.

Props:
- are **read-only**
- flow from **parent → child**
- cannot be changed by the child

If a child needs different data, the **parent must provide it**.

---

## State lives at the top
**State** is usually stored:
- in the component that needs it most, or
- in a **common parent** shared by multiple children

This is sometimes called **lifting state up**.

Only the component that **owns the state** should update it.

---

## How changes happen
If a child needs to trigger a change:

1. The parent passes a **function** to the child  
2. The child calls that function (for example, on a click)  
3. The parent updates the **state**  
4. React re-renders the UI with new data  

Even though actions can start in children, the **data still flows down**.

---

## What one-way data flow does NOT mean
It does NOT mean:
- children are useless
- data can never change
- components cannot communicate

It means data changes are **controlled and predictable**.

---

## Why this matters with the Virtual DOM
When state changes:
- React recalculates what the UI should look like
- a new Virtual DOM is created
- updates flow down through the component tree

One-way data flow makes this process reliable and efficient.

---

## Summary
- Data flows from **parent → child**
- Props are **read-only**
- State is owned and updated by **parent components**
- Children request changes via **functions**
- One-way data flow makes apps predictable and easier to reason about
