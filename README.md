# Knowledge Base

A structured reference repository for core concepts, patterns, and practical notes, maintained for quick lookup and consistency.

This repository contains notes on frontend development concepts, patterns, and recurring practices,
organised by topic rather than by project.

The notes are informal, evolving, and written primarily for future reference.

### Credits

Some of the context and structure in this knowledge base were inspired by discussions and materials from [Valeriy Komlev](https://github.com/komlev).
