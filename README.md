# Knowledge Base

A personal knowledge base for things I’ve learned, figured out, or don’t want to forget.

This repo contains notes on frontend development concepts, patterns, and practical learnings,
organised by topic rather than by project.

Notes are informal, evolving, and written for future reference.

### Credits
Some of the context and structure in this knowledge base were inspired by discussions and materials from [Valeriy Komlev](https://github.com/komlev).
