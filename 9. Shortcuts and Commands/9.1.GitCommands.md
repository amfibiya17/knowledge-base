# 9.1 Git Commands

Common Git commands for everyday development and recovery.

---

## Setup & Configuration

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
# Sets your name for all Git commits (who you are)

git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
# Sets your email for all Git commits

git config --list
# Shows all Git settings currently in use
```

## Repository Basics

```bash
git init
# Turns the current folder into a Git repository

git clone <repo-url>
# Downloads a remote repository to your computer

git status
# Shows what files are changed, staged, or untracked
```

## Working with Files

```bash
git add file.txt
# Tells Git: "I want this file included in the next commit"

git add .
# Stages ALL changed files

git restore .
# Discards ALL unstaged local changes (dangerous)

git restore file.txt
# Discards changes in a file (goes back to last commit)

git restore --staged file.txt
# Removes file from staging area but keeps your changes
```

## Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "message"
# Saves a snapshot of staged changes with a message

git commit -am "message"
# Stages AND commits tracked files in one step (new files are NOT included)

git commit --amend
# Changes the last commit (message or files)
```

## Viewing History

```bash
git log
# Shows full commit history

git log --oneline
# Shows compact commit history (short and readable)

git show <commit-hash>
# Shows details of a specific commit

git diff
# Shows changes NOT yet staged

git diff --staged
# Shows changes that ARE staged
```

## Branches

```bash
git branch
# Lists all local branches

git branch -a
# Shows local AND remote branches

git branch feature
# Creates a new branch called "feature"

git checkout feature
# Switches to the "feature" branch

git checkout -b feature
# Creates AND switches to a new branch

git branch -d feature
# Deletes a branch (safe delete)
```

## Merging

```bash
git merge feature
# Combines "feature" branch into the current branch

git merge --abort
# Cancels a merge if something went wrong
```

## Rebasing

```bash
git rebase main
# Replays your commits on top of main (keeps history clean)

git rebase -i HEAD~3
# Lets you edit, squash, or reorder last 3 commits

git rebase --abort
# Cancels the rebase and goes back to how things were
```

## Remote Repositories

```bash
git remote -v
# Shows connected remote repositories

git fetch
# Downloads changes but DOES NOT apply them

git pull
# Downloads changes AND applies them

git push
# Sends your commits to the remote repo

git push -u origin branch-name
# Pushes branch and links it to the remote
```

## Stashing (Temporary Storage)

```bash
git stash
# Saves unfinished work temporarily

git stash list
# Shows all saved stashes

git stash pop
# Restores last stash AND removes it

git stash apply
# Restores stash but keeps it saved
```

## Undoing Things

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Undo last commit but keep changes staged

git reset --hard HEAD~1
# Undo last commit AND DELETE changes (dangerous)

git revert <commit>
# Creates a new commit that undoes another commit (safe)
```

## Recovery (When Panicking)

```bash
git reflog
# Shows EVERYTHING you've done (even deleted commits)

git reset --hard <hash>
# Jumps to a previous state and deletes all changes after it (dangerous)
```

## Cleaning Up

```bash
git clean -n
# Shows what would be deleted (safe preview)

git clean -f
# Deletes untracked files

git clean -fd
# Deletes untracked files AND folders
```

## Tags

```bash
git tag
# Lists all tags

git tag v1.0.0
# Creates a version tag

git push --tags
# Pushes tags to the remote
```

## Advanced but Useful

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit>
# Copies a commit from another branch

git bisect
# Helps find which commit introduced a bug

git archive HEAD > project.zip
# Exports repo as a ZIP (no .git folder)
```

## Dangerous Commands (Think Twice)

```bash
git reset --hard
# Deletes local changes forever

git push --force
# Overwrites remote history (can break things)

git push --force-with-lease
# Safer version of force push (won’t overwrite others’ work)
```
