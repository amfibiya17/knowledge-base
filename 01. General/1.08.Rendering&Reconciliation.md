# 1.08 Rendering & Reconciliation

This file explains how React updates the UI when data changes.
It focuses on **rendering**, **re-rendering**, and **reconciliation**.

---

## What rendering means in React

In React, **rendering** means:

- running a component function
- producing a description of the UI (Virtual DOM)

Rendering does **not** directly update the browser DOM.

---

## Initial render

When a component first appears:

1. React runs the component
2. JSX is converted into Virtual DOM objects
3. React updates the real DOM to match

This is the **initial render**.

---

## What re-rendering means

A **re-render** happens when React runs a component again.

A component re-renders when:

- its **state** changes
- its **props** change
- its **parent** re-renders

Re-rendering is **normal and expected** in React.

---

## Re-rendering does NOT mean DOM updates

Important distinction:

- Re-rendering = React recalculates UI
- DOM update = browser changes what you see

React may re-render a component **without changing the DOM at all**.

---

## Why React can re-render often

Re-rendering is cheap because:

- React works with JavaScript objects (Virtual DOM)
- the browser DOM is only touched when necessary

This allows React to re-render freely without performance issues.

---

## What reconciliation is

**Reconciliation** is the process where React:

- compares the previous Virtual DOM
- with the new Virtual DOM
- finds what changed

This comparison is often called **diffing**.

---

## How reconciliation works

When data changes:

1. React creates a new Virtual DOM
2. React compares it to the previous one
3. React identifies the minimal set of changes
4. Only those changes are applied to the real DOM

The entire page is **not** re-rendered.

---

## The role of keys in reconciliation

When rendering lists:

- React uses **keys** to identify items
- keys help React match old and new elements

Without keys, React may:

- reuse the wrong DOM nodes
- keep incorrect state
- cause visual bugs

Keys are essential for correct reconciliation.

---

## Why immutability matters here

React relies on **reference changes** to detect updates.

If state is mutated:

- React may not detect the change
- reconciliation can break

Creating new objects ensures React can compare correctly.

---

## Common misconceptions

- Re-rendering is not slow by default
- React does not update the DOM on every render
- Virtual DOM is not the same as the real DOM
- Reconciliation is not magic - it’s comparison

---

## Summary

- Rendering creates a Virtual DOM description
- Re-rendering happens when state or props change
- Re-rendering does not always update the DOM
- Reconciliation compares Virtual DOM versions
- Only necessary DOM updates are applied
- Keys and immutability are critical for correctness
