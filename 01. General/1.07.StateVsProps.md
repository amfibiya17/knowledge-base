# 1.07 State vs Props

This file explains the difference between **state** and **props** in React.
Understanding this distinction is essential for building predictable components.

---

## What props are

**Props** (short for _properties_) are data passed **from a parent component to a child component**.

Props:

- flow from parent → child
- are **read-only**
- cannot be changed by the component that receives them

Props allow components to be **configured and reused**.

---

## Example of props

```jsx
function Parent() {
  return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <p>Hello {name}</p>;
}
```

Here:

- Parent owns the data
- `Greeting` receives `name` as a prop
- `Greeting` cannot change `name`

---

## What state is

**State** is data that:

- belongs to a component
- can change over time
- causes the component to re-render when updated

State represents **dynamic data** that affects the UI.

---

## Example of state

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

Here:

- `count` is state
- `setCount` updates the state
- updating state triggers a re-render

## Key differences between state and props

| Props                   | State                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Passed into a component | Managed inside a component  |
| Read-only               | Can be updated              |
| Controlled by parent    | Controlled by the component |
| Used for configuration  | Used for dynamic behaviour  |

---

## Who owns the data

A simple rule:

> **The component that owns the data is the one that can change it.**

- Props are owned by the parent
- State is owned by the component that defines it

Ownership determines **where updates happen**.

---

## Updating data: the correct way

A child component **never changes props directly**.

If a child needs to trigger a change:

1. The parent passes a function as a prop
2. The child calls that function
3. The parent updates state
4. New props flow down

---

## Example: child triggering a state change

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <Child count={count} onIncrement={() => setCount(count + 1)} />;
}

function Child({ count, onIncrement }) {
  return <button onClick={onIncrement}>{count}</button>;
}
```

Data still flows **down**, even though the action starts in the child.

---

## Lifting state up

Sometimes multiple components need the same data.

In this case:

- state is moved to the **closest common parent**
- the parent passes data down via props

This is called **lifting state up**.

---

## Common mistakes

- Trying to change props directly
- Duplicating the same state in multiple components
- Storing derived data in state
- Putting state too low in the component tree

---

## Mental model

- **Props** → data coming into a component
- **State** → data owned by a component
- **Parent** controls data
- **Children** display data and request changes

---

## Summary

- Props are read-only inputs to a component
- State represents changeable data
- Only the owner of state can update it
- Data flows from parent to child
- Children request changes via functions
- Clear ownership leads to predictable UI
