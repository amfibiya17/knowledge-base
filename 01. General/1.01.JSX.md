# 1.01 JSX

## What JSX is

JSX (JavaScript XML -> eXtensible Markup Language) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.
It looks similar to HTML, but it is not HTML.

JSX allows you to describe UI structure directly inside JavaScript.
JSX cannot run in the browser directly, so it is compiled into plain JavaScript first.

---

## Why JSX exists

- Makes UI code easier to read and understand
- Keeps structure and logic close together
- Reduces the need for manual DOM manipulation

---

## JSX vs HTML

Although JSX looks like HTML, there are important differences:

- JSX is JavaScript
- JSX expressions must return a single parent element
- Attribute names often differ from HTML
- Values can be dynamic using JavaScript expressions

---

## Embedding JavaScript

JavaScript expressions can be embedded in JSX using curly braces `{}`.

```jsx
<p>Hello {name}</p>
<p>{2 + 2}</p>
<p>{isLoggedIn ? "Welcome" : "Please log in"}</p>
```

Only expressions are allowed — not statements like `if` or `for`.

---

## Common rules and gotchas

- Components must return one root element
- Use a wrapper element or a Fragment (`<>`...`</>`)
- Use className instead of class
- Use camelCase for event handlers (onClick, onChange)
- Self-close tags with no children (`<img />`, `<input />`)

---

## Rendering lists

- When rendering lists, each item must have a `key` prop

```jsx
items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>);
```

- Keys should be stable and unique
- Avoid using array indexes as keys unless the list is static
- Keys help React identify which list items have changed, been added, or removed
- Using array indexes as keys can cause bugs when list items change order or are updated
- Keys identify items, not positions

---

## Conditional rendering patterns

Common patterns include:

If `isLoggedIn` is true → show `<Dashboard />`,
If false → show nothing

```jsx
{
  isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />;
}
```

If `isError` is true → show `<Error />`,
Else → show `<Success />`

```jsx
{
  isError ? <Error /> : <Success />;
}
```

---

## Summary

- JSX is JavaScript, not HTML
- It improves readability and UI structure
- JavaScript expressions are embedded using { }
- JSX has strict syntax rules that often cause bugs when forgotten
- Most JSX bugs come from small syntax mistakes rather than complex logic
- Some attributes are renamed (className, htmlFor, style object)
