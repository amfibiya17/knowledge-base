# 10.03 Axios

**Axios** is an **HTTP client library** for making API requests
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the browser or Node.js.

It is a popular alternative to the native `fetch` API.

---

## What Axios is for

Axios is used to:

- send HTTP requests
- handle JSON automatically
- configure headers and base URLs
- intercept requests and responses
- handle errors consistently

It makes network requests easier and cleaner.

---

## Basic example

```ts
import axios from "axios";

const res = await axios.get("/api/users");
console.log(res.data);
```

Key difference vs `fetch`:

- Axios **automatically parses JSON responses**
- response data is in `res.data`

---

## POST example

```ts
await axios.post("/api/users", {
  name: "Anna",
  email: "anna@test.com",
});
```

Axios automatically sends JSON and sets the correct headers.

No need to manually stringify JSON.

---

## Why people use Axios instead of fetch

Axios provides:

- automatic JSON parsing
- supports request cancellation
- request / response interceptors
- consistent error handling
- cleaner syntax for many teams

With `fetch`, you must handle more manually.

---

## Interceptors (important feature!)

Interceptors let you run logic **before or after requests**.

Example use cases:

- add auth tokens
- log errors
- handle 401 redirects

```ts
axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer token`;
  return config;
});
```

---

## Axios + React Query (common combo)

Axios is often used **with React Query**

```ts
const fetchUsers = () => axios.get("/api/users").then((res) => res.data);
```

- **Axios** → how data is fetched, sends HTTP requests
- **React Query** → caching, syncing, state, manages server state

This is a very common setup.

---

## When Axios is a good choice

Use Axios when:

- you want interceptors
- you want cleaner request syntax
- your team prefers it over `fetch`
- you need consistent API handling

---

## When you may not need Axios

You might skip it when:

- using `fetch` directly is enough
- project is very small
- no shared request configuration is needed

Modern `fetch` is perfectly fine in many cases.

---

## Mental model

- Axios → **how you send requests to the server**
- React Query → **how to manage server data**

---

## Summary

- Axios is an HTTP client library
- It simplifies API requests
- Handles JSON and errors cleanly
- Supports interceptors and configuration
- Commonly used with React Query
- Not required, but very popular and reliable
