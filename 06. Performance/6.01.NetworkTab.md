# 6.01 Network Tab (Browser DevTools)

The **Network tab** in browser DevTools shows **everything your app loads**
over the network.

It is one of the **most important tools for performance debugging**.

---

## Network tab

The Network tab shows **all network requests**, such as:

- HTML documents
- JavaScript files
- CSS files
- images
- fonts
- API requests (XHR / fetch)
- third-party scripts

Each request shows:

- what was loaded
- how long it took
- how big it was
- where it came from

---

## Why the Network tab matters

Performance problems often come from:

- too many requests
- large files
- slow APIs
- blocking resources
- unnecessary third-party scripts

The Network tab helps you **see these problems clearly**.

---

## Common request types

You will often see these types:

- **Document** → main HTML
- **JS** → JavaScript bundles
- **CSS** → stylesheets
- **Img** → images
- **Font** → web fonts
- **XHR / Fetch** → API calls

Knowing the type helps you understand **what is slowing the page down**.

---

## Key columns to understand

### Name

- the file or endpoint being loaded
- helps identify **what** is being requested

---

### Status

- `200` → OK
- `304` → cached (good!)
- `404` → missing
- `500` → server error

---

### Size

- shows how large the response is
- includes compressed size (often `gzip` or `br`)

Large JS or image files are common performance issues.

---

### Time

- total time for the request
- includes network + server time

Slow requests = slow page.

---

## Waterfall

The **waterfall** shows **when requests start and finish**.

It helps you see:

- which requests block others
- which requests run in parallel
- which requests delay rendering

Things to watch for:

- long bars → slow requests
- many requests starting late → blocking
- JS files blocking CSS or HTML

---

## Render-blocking resources

Some resources **can block page rendering**, especially:

- render-blocking CSS files
- synchronous JavaScript in `<head>`

In the Network tab you can spot:

- CSS loaded before content appears
- JS loaded early that delays rendering

This explains **“blank screen” issues**.

---

## API requests (XHR / Fetch)

For API calls, the Network tab helps you check:

- how long requests take
- how often they are called
- whether they are duplicated
- response size and payload

Common problems:

- fetching the same data multiple times
- slow backend responses
- huge JSON payloads

---

## Caching

The Network tab shows caching behaviour:

- `304 Not Modified` → cached
- `(from disk cache)` → very good
- `(from memory cache)` → excellent

If everything loads with `200` on every refresh,
caching is probably missing.

---

## Disable cache (debugging tip)

In DevTools you can check **“Disable cache”**.

Use this when:

- testing first load
- simulating a new user
- checking worst-case performance

Never judge performance only with cache enabled.

---

## Throttling (simulate slow users)

You can throttle the network to simulate:

- Slow 3G
- Fast 3G
- Custom speeds

This helps you understand:

- real-world user experience
- how your app behaves on bad connections

Many apps feel fine on fast Wi-Fi but break on slow networks.

---

## Mental model

- Network tab → **what is loaded**
- Size → **how heavy it is**
- Time → **how slow it is**
- Waterfall → **what blocks what**

---

## Summary

- The Network tab shows all network activity
- It is essential for performance debugging
- Helps identify slow, large, or unnecessary requests
- Waterfall view explains rendering delays
- Caching and throttling reveal real user experience
- Always check Network before guessing performance issues
