# 6.09 Reset Styles

**Reset styles** are used to **remove or normalise browser default styles**
so that your UI starts from a **predictable baseline**.

Different browsers apply different default styles.
Resets help avoid **inconsistent appearance and layout bugs**.

---

## Why reset styles are needed

Browsers come with built-in CSS for elements like:

- margins on `<body>`
- font sizes for headings
- list bullets and padding
- form element styles
- button appearance

Example problem:

- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- all style elements slightly differently

Without a reset:

> The same HTML can look different across browsers.

---

## What a reset does

A reset:

- removes default margins and paddings
- normalises font inheritance
- makes box sizing predictable
- reduces browser inconsistencies

It does **not** add design -
it just creates a clean starting point.

---

## Simple reset example

A very common minimal reset:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

This alone prevents many layout surprises.

---

## Full CSS resets (old approach)

Classic resets remove almost everything:

```css
html,
body,
div,
span,
applet,
object,
iframe,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
p,
blockquote,
pre,
a,
abbr,
acronym,
address,
big,
cite,
code,
img,
ins,
kbd,
q,
s,
samp,
small,
strike,
strong,
sub,
sup,
tt,
var,
b,
u,
i,
center,
dl,
dt,
dd,
ol,
ul,
li,
fieldset,
form,
label,
legend,
table,
caption,
tbody,
tfoot,
thead,
tr,
th,
td {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
}
```

These are **less common today** because they:

- remove useful defaults
- require rebuilding everything
- can hurt accessibility if misused

---

## Normalisation (modern approach)

Instead of resetting everything,
modern projects often **normalise** styles.

**Normalize.css** is the most famous example.

It:

- keeps sensible defaults
- fixes inconsistencies
- improves cross-browser rendering
- respects accessibility

Normalization is usually preferred over hard resets.

---

## Reset styles vs Normalize.css

**Reset styles**

- remove most browser defaults
- very strict
- more work afterwards

**Normalize.css**

- preserves useful defaults
- fixes inconsistencies
- safer and more modern

Many teams use:

> small reset + normalization

---

## Reset styles in modern setups

Today, resets often come from:

- CSS frameworks
- utility libraries
- build tools

Examples:

- Tailwind → **Preflight**
- Bootstrap → built-in reset
- Next.js examples → small global reset

You may not need to write one yourself.

---

## What should be reset today (best practice)

Common modern reset choices:

- `box-sizing: border-box`
- remove default body margin
- inherit fonts for form elements
- consistent line-height

Example:

```css
body {
  font-family: inherit;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

button,
input,
textarea,
select {
  font: inherit;
}
```

---

## What NOT to reset

Avoid resetting:

- focus outlines (accessibility!)
- default link behaviour
- semantic meaning of elements
- form usability features

---

## Common mistakes

- copying huge reset files blindly
- removing all defaults “just in case”
- breaking form controls
- removing focus styles
- mixing reset logic into component CSS

Resets belong in **global CSS**, not components.

---

## Mental model

- Browser defaults → inconsistent
- Reset → clean baseline
- Normalize → safe consistency
- Design → added later

---

## Summary

- Reset styles remove browser inconsistencies
- They create a predictable starting point
- Modern projects prefer normalisation
- Small resets are usually enough
- Avoid aggressive resets
- Accessibility must be preserved (!)
- Reset styles belong in global CSS
