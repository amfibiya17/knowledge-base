# 6.11 Core Web Vitals

**Core Web Vitals** are a set of metrics from Google that measure
**real user experience performance**.

They focus on:

- loading speed
- visual stability
- interaction responsiveness

They answer:

> “Does this page feel fast and stable to the user?”

Core Web Vitals are used in:

- Lighthouse reports
- PageSpeed Insights
- Google Search ranking signals

---

## The three Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals measure three things:

- **LCP** - loading speed
- **CLS** - layout stability
- **INP** - interaction responsiveness

---

## LCP - Largest Contentful Paint

**LCP** measures:

> When the main visible content finishes loading.

Usually this is:

- hero image
- large heading
- main banner
- big content block

### Good target

```
LCP < 2.5 seconds
```

### Common causes of slow LCP

- large images
- unoptimised hero images
- slow server response
- render-blocking CSS/JS
- no image optimisation

### Fix ideas

- optimise images
- use modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
- preload hero image
- reduce blocking resources
- use CDN

---

## CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift

**CLS** measures:

> How much the layout jumps while loading.

Bad example:

- text moves down when image loads
- button shifts while you try to click
- content jumps after ads load

### Good target

```
CLS < 0.1
```

### Common causes

- images without width/height
- ads inserted late
- dynamic content above existing content
- fonts swapping late

### Fix ideas

- always set image dimensions
- reserve space for dynamic content
- avoid inserting content above existing layout
- use font display strategies

---

## INP - Interaction to Next Paint

**INP** measures:

> How quickly the page responds to user actions.

Examples:

- click
- tap
- key press

It checks how long until the UI updates.

### Good target

```
INP < 200 ms
```

### Common causes of bad INP

- heavy JavaScript
- long tasks on main thread
- big React renders
- expensive event handlers

### Fix ideas

- reduce JS bundle size
- split code (dynamic imports)
- use Web Workers for heavy work
- avoid heavy logic in event handlers
- use throttle/debounce when needed

---

## How Core Web Vitals are measured

Two types of data:

### Lab data

Measured by tools:

- Lighthouse
- DevTools
- PageSpeed Insights (lab section)

Simulated environment.

---

### Real user data (field data)

Measured from real visitors:

- Chrome User Experience Report
- PageSpeed Insights (field section)

This is what Google ranking uses.

---

## Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals

Lighthouse shows:

- LCP
- CLS
- TBT (lab proxy for INP)

Important:

> Lighthouse is a guide - not final truth (!)

Always check:

- multiple runs
- real devices
- real user data if available

---

## Core Web Vitals vs general performance

Core Web Vitals are **user-experience metrics**, not code metrics.

They do not measure:

- code style
- architecture quality
- bundle structure directly

They measure:

- what the user feels

---

## Common mistakes

- chasing Lighthouse score only
- lazy-loading hero images (hurts LCP)
- ignoring CLS layout shifts
- optimising JS but not images
- fixing lab data but ignoring real users

---

## Mental model

- LCP → how fast main content appears
- CLS → how stable layout is
- INP → how fast page reacts

Think:

> fast + stable + responsive

---

## Summary

- Core Web Vitals measure real user experience
- Three metrics: **LCP, CLS, INP**
- They affect SEO ranking
- Lighthouse reports them
- Images strongly affect LCP
- Layout shifts affect CLS
- Heavy JS affects INP
- Optimise for users, not just scores (!)
