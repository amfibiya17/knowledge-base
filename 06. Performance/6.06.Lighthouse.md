# 6.06 Lighthouse (Performance Auditing)

Lighthouse is an automated auditing tool that can run from Chrome DevTools,
the Lighthouse CLI, and online tools like PageSpeed Insights. It audits your site for **performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices**.

It answers the question:

> “How good is this page for real users?”

Lighthouse is a **diagnostic tool**, not a magic fix.

---

## What Lighthouse is

Lighthouse runs a series of **automated checks** and produces a report with:

- scores (0–100)
- concrete metrics
- warnings and recommendations

It simulates a **real user on a slow device and network**.

---

## Where Lighthouse lives

You can run Lighthouse from:

- Chrome DevTools → **Lighthouse** tab
- Chrome extension
- CI tools (e.g. GitHub Actions)
- PageSpeed Insights (online)

For learning and debugging, **DevTools is enough**.

---

## What Lighthouse measures

Lighthouse focuses on **user experience**, not just code quality.

Key categories:

- **Performance**
- **Accessibility**
- **Best Practices**
- **SEO** (Search Engine Optimisation)

There is also PWA (Progressive Web App), if relevant.

---

## Performance metrics

### Core Web Vitals (very important)

Lighthouse reports **Core Web Vitals**, including:

### LCP - Largest Contentful Paint

- when the main content becomes visible
- target: **< 2.5s**

Slow LCP usually means:

- large images
- slow server response
- render-blocking resources

---

### CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift

- how much the layout moves while loading
- target: **< 0.1**

Bad CLS usually means:

- images without dimensions
- ads loading late
- content injected dynamically

---

### TBT (lab) / INP (real users) - Interactivity

- how responsive the page feels
- affected by long JavaScript tasks

Problems here usually mean:

- too much JS
- heavy React rendering
- blocked main thread

---

## Other important Lighthouse checks

Lighthouse also flags:

- unused JavaScript
- unused CSS
- render-blocking resources
- large bundle sizes
- missing image optimisation
- lack of caching
- slow server responses

These directly connect to what you saw in:

- Network tab
- Performance tab

---

## Accessibility audit (A11y)

The Accessibility score checks for:

- missing labels
- colour contrast
- ARIA misuse
- missing landmarks
- focus issues

Important:

> A high score does **not** mean perfect accessibility.  
> Lighthouse catches common issues, not all issues.

Manual testing is still required.

---

## SEO audit

SEO checks include:

- proper HTML structure
- meta tags
- link accessibility
- mobile friendliness
- crawlability basics

Lighthouse SEO is **baseline**, not full SEO strategy.

---

## How to run Lighthouse correctly

Important tips:

- run in **Incognito**
- disable extensions
- use default throttling
- test a **real page**, not localhost mock data
- run multiple times (results vary)

Never trust a single run blindly.

---

## Interpreting scores (!)

Scores are **signals**, not goals.

- 90–100 → good
- 50–89 → needs improvement
- < 50 → serious issues

Do not “chase 100”.

Ask instead:

> “Which issues actually affect users?”

---

## Lighthouse vs DevTools tabs

**Lighthouse**

- high-level overview
- automated suggestions
- user-focused metrics

**Network / Performance tabs**

- low-level debugging
- exact causes
- real execution details

Use Lighthouse to **identify problems**,
then DevTools to **fix them**.

---

## Common Lighthouse mistakes

- chasing score instead of UX
- ignoring real user data
- optimising only for Lighthouse
- disabling features just to improve score
- assuming green = done

A fast app can still score badly,
and a slow app can score deceptively well (!)

---

## Real users vs Lighthouse

Lighthouse uses **lab data**.

Real users may experience:

- slower devices
- worse networks
- background tabs
- older browsers

Always combine Lighthouse with:

- real user monitoring (RUM)
- feedback
- analytics

---

## Mental model

- Lighthouse → health check
- Scores → symptoms
- DevTools → diagnosis
- Fixes → measured improvements

Think:

> “What hurts the user the most right now?”

---

## Summary

- Lighthouse is an automated auditing tool
- Measures performance, A11y, SEO, best practices
- Focuses on real-user experience
- Core Web Vitals are key metrics
- Scores guide investigation, not perfection
- Optimise for users, not for the score
