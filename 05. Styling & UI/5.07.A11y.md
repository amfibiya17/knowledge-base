# 5.07 Accessibility (A11y): ARIA Patterns & Semantics

Accessibility (A11y) means **making your UI usable by everyone**,
including people who use:

- screen readers
- keyboards instead of a mouse
- assistive technologies
- different devices and input methods

Accessibility is **not optional** - it is part of professional frontend work.

---

## What accessibility really means

Accessibility is about **meaning, behaviour, and structure** -
not just how things look.

A button is not just something that _looks clickable_.
It must:

- be focusable
- work with keyboard
- announce itself correctly to screen readers
- behave predictably

Accessibility starts with **HTML semantics**.

Examples use HTML or JSX depending on context.

---

## Semantics first (most important rule)

### Always use the correct HTML element

Native HTML elements already include:

- keyboard support
- focus handling
- screen reader behaviour
- accessibility roles

Examples:

| UI purpose | Correct element |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Action     | `<button>`      |
| Navigation | `<a>`           |
| Input      | `<input>`       |
| Grouping   | `<fieldset>`    |
| Heading    | `<h1>`–`<h6>`   |

Example (good):

```html
<button>Save</button>
```

Example (bad):

```html
<div onClick="{save}">Save</div>
```

The `<div>`:

- has no semantic meaning
- is not keyboard accessible
- requires ARIA + JS just to behave like a button

---

## The golden rule of ARIA

> **Do not use ARIA if native HTML can do the job.**

ARIA is **not a replacement for HTML**.

Bad:

```html
<div role="button">Click</div>
```

Good:

```html
<button>Click</button>
```

If you use ARIA instead of correct HTML - you’re doing it wrong.

---

## What ARIA is (and is not)

ARIA stands for:

> **Accessible Rich Internet Applications**

ARIA allows you to:

- describe **what something is** (roles)
- describe **its current state** (states)
- describe **extra meaning** (properties)

ARIA does **not**:

- add keyboard support automatically
- add focus management
- fix broken logic
- replace semantic HTML

ARIA only **communicates meaning**.

---

## ARIA roles - when and why to use them

### What roles do

Roles tell assistive technologies **what kind of UI element this is**.

You use roles when:

- native HTML has no equivalent
- you are building a custom component

---

## Common ARIA roles and when to use them

### `role="dialog"`

Use when:

- building a modal or dialog
- content interrupts the user’s flow

Why:

- screen readers announce it as a dialog
- users know context has changed

Focus must move into the dialog and return on close.

```html
<div role="dialog" aria-modal="true"></div>
```

---

### `role="navigation"`

Use when:

- marking major navigation regions
- especially useful for screen reader landmarks

```html
<nav></nav>
```

`<nav>` already has `role="navigation"` - don’t add it manually.

---

### `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`

Use when:

- building custom tabs
- native tabs do not exist in HTML

Why:

- screen readers understand tab relationships
- keyboard users expect arrow-key navigation

---

### `role="alert"`

Use when:

- important information must be announced immediately
- errors or critical messages

Why:

- screen readers announce alerts automatically

```html
<div role="alert">Payment failed</div>
```

---

## ARIA states & properties - when and why

ARIA states describe **current UI state**.

### `aria-expanded`

Use when:

- content can expand/collapse
- dropdowns, accordions, menus

Why:

- screen readers announce whether content is open

```jsx
<button aria-expanded={isOpen}>
```

---

### `aria-selected`

Use when:

- selecting items in a group
- tabs, listboxes, menus

Why:

- communicates which item is active

---

### `aria-pressed`

Use when:

- toggle buttons
- on/off states

Why:

- screen readers announce toggle state

```jsx
<button aria-pressed={isOn}>Bold</button>
```

---

### `aria-disabled`

Use when:

- disabling custom interactive elements

Why:

- communicates disabled state even when `disabled` attribute isn’t available

`aria-disabled` does not prevent interaction - you must handle this in JS.

---

### `aria-label`

Use when:

- visible text is missing or insufficient
- icon-only buttons

Why:

- provides an accessible name

```jsx
<button aria-label="Close modal">✕</button>
```

---

## ARIA patterns (very important)

ARIA patterns are **documented best practices**
for common UI components.

Examples:

- Tabs
- Modals
- Accordions
- Menus
- Tooltips

Each pattern defines:

- required roles
- required ARIA attributes
- required keyboard behaviour

> If you invent your own pattern, accessibility will break.

Follow official patterns whenever possible.

---

## Keyboard accessibility (non-negotiable)

Every interactive element must be usable with:

- `Tab`
- `Enter`
- `Space`
- arrow keys (for lists, tabs, menus)

ARIA does not add keyboard behaviour - you must implement it yourself.

---

## Focus management

Focus tells users **where they are**.

You must manage focus when:

- opening modals
- closing dialogs
- rendering dynamic content

Bad focus management = unusable UI.

Never remove focus outlines without replacement.

---

## Common accessibility mistakes

- using `<div>` for everything
- adding ARIA without understanding it
- missing input labels
- removing focus styles
- assuming screen readers “guess”

---

## Mental model

- HTML → meaning
- JS → behaviour
- ARIA → extra meaning
- CSS → appearance

Ask yourself:

> “Can someone use this with **only a keyboard and a screen reader**?”

---

## When to use ARIA

Use ARIA when:

- building custom UI components
- following a documented ARIA pattern
- native HTML is not enough

Avoid ARIA when:

- a native element exists
- you’re fixing poor semantics
- you don’t understand the role/state

---

## Summary

- Accessibility starts with semantic HTML
- ARIA adds meaning when HTML is insufficient
- Never replace native elements with ARIA
- Roles describe _what it is_
- States describe _what state it’s in_
- ARIA does not add behaviour
- Keyboard and focus handling are mandatory
- Accessibility is part of professional frontend engineering
