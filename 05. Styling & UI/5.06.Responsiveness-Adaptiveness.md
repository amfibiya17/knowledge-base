# 5.06 Responsiveness & Adaptiveness

Responsiveness and adaptiveness describe **how UI behaves across different screen sizes
and devices**.

They solve the problem of:

> “How does this UI work on mobile, tablet, and desktop?”

---

## What responsiveness is

**Responsive design** means:

- one layout
- fluid and flexible
- adjusts continuously to screen size

The same UI adapts smoothly as the viewport changes.

Common techniques:

- flexible layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- relative units (`%`, `rem`, `vw`)
- media queries
- responsive utility classes

Example idea:

```css
.container {
  padding: 16px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 32px;
  }
}
```

The layout **responds** to screen width.

## What adaptiveness is

**Adaptive design** means:

- multiple distinct layouts
- each designed for a specific breakpoint
- layout switches at defined sizes

Instead of fluid changes, the UI **jumps** between versions.

Example idea:

- mobile layout
- tablet layout
- desktop layout

Often implemented by:

- conditional rendering
- breakpoint-based components
- device-specific layouts

---

## Responsive vs Adaptive (core difference)

**Responsive**

- continuous adjustment
- same components
- flexible sizing
- fewer layout versions

**Adaptive**

- discrete breakpoints
- different layouts
- conditional logic
- more control per device

---

## Responsiveness in modern React apps

Most React apps are **primarily responsive**.

Common approaches:

### CSS-based responsiveness

- media queries
- CSS Grid / Flexbox
- utility frameworks (Tailwind)

Example (Tailwind):

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3">
```

---

### Component-level responsiveness

Sometimes layout logic lives in components:

```jsx
{
  isDesktop ? <Sidebar /> : <MobileMenu />;
}
```

Used when:

- behaviour changes
- not just layout
- different interactions are needed

---

## When adaptiveness is useful

Adaptive patterns make sense when:

- mobile and desktop UX are very different
- performance matters on mobile
- features differ by device
- layouts are complex

Examples:

- mobile-first navigation
- desktop-only sidebars
- touch vs mouse interactions

---

## Mobile-first design

Modern best practice is **mobile-first**.

That means:

- design for small screens first
- progressively enhance for larger screens

Example:

```css
.card {
  padding: 12px;
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .card {
    padding: 24px;
  }
}
```

Mobile styles are the default.

---

## Responsiveness vs Adaptiveness in practice

Most apps use **both**:

- responsive CSS for layout
- adaptive logic for behaviour

Example:

- responsive grid
- adaptive navigation
- adaptive component visibility

They are **complementary**, not exclusive.

---

## Common mistakes

- designing desktop first and squeezing to mobile
- hiding content instead of redesigning flow
- relying only on breakpoints without layout thinking
- putting too much logic in JavaScript
- ignoring touch and accessibility needs

---

## Mental model

- Responsive → fluid layout
- Adaptive → layout switch
- CSS → layout changes
- JS → behaviour changes

---

## Summary

- Responsiveness adjusts layouts fluidly
- Adaptiveness switches between layouts
- Most apps are primarily responsive
- Adaptive logic is used when behaviour differs
- Mobile-first design is best practice
- Use CSS for layout, JS for behaviour
- Combine both intentionally, not accidentally
