# 5.08 Sass / Less (CSS Preprocessors)

Sass and Less are **CSS preprocessors**.
They extend normal CSS with **extra features** that make styles easier to write
and maintain in larger projects.

They are compiled into **plain CSS** before reaching the browser.

---

## What CSS preprocessors are

CSS preprocessors let you write CSS with:

- variables
- nesting
- reusable logic
- better organisation

The browser never sees Sass or Less -
it only sees the compiled CSS.

---

## Sass vs Less (quick overview)

- **Sass (SCSS)** → most popular today
- **Less** → older, still used in some projects

Sass is generally preferred in modern React apps.

---

## Common features (Sass & Less)

### Variables

```scss
$primary: #0055ff;

.button {
  background: $primary;
}
```

This was useful **before CSS variables existed**.

---

### Nesting

```scss
.card {
  padding: 16px;

  .title {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
}
```

This helps group related styles,
but can easily become **too deeply nested**.

---

### Partials & imports

```scss
@import "variables";
@import "buttons";
```

Allows splitting CSS into multiple files.

Modern tools prefer `@use` instead of `@import` in Sass.

---

### Mixins (reusable snippets)

```scss
@mixin center {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.box {
  @include center;
}
```

Useful for repeating patterns,
but can hide complexity if overused.

---

## Why Sass / Less existed

They solved problems like:

- lack of variables in CSS
- poor organisation of large stylesheets
- repeated values and patterns
- limited expressiveness of old CSS

At the time, plain CSS was very limited.

---

## Sass / Less today

Many Sass features are now available in **modern CSS**:

- CSS variables (`--var`)
- nesting (in progress / supported in some tools)
- better build tooling
- CSS Modules
- utility frameworks

Because of this:

> Sass is **less critical** than it used to be.

---

## When Sass / Less still make sense

They can still be useful when:

- working in older codebases
- maintaining large legacy stylesheets
- no CSS Modules or utility framework is used
- team is already invested in Sass

---

## Sass / Less vs modern alternatives

- **Sass/Less** → preprocess CSS
- **CSS Modules** → scope CSS
- **Utility CSS** → compose styles in markup
- **CSS-in-JS** → dynamic, JS-driven styles

They solve **different problems**.

---

## Common mistakes

- very deep nesting
- using mixins instead of CSS variables
- duplicating logic across files
- treating Sass as a design system

Sass improves CSS - it does not replace design thinking.

---

## Mental model

- Sass/Less → write CSS more comfortably
- Output → still just CSS
- Modern CSS → often enough without preprocessors

---

## Summary

- Sass and Less are CSS preprocessors
- They add variables, nesting, and reuse
- Sass (SCSS) is more common than Less today
- Many features are now native to CSS
- Useful mainly for legacy or large CSS codebases
- Not required for most modern React apps
