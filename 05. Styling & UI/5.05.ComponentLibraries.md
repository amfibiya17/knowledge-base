# 5.05 Component Libraries

Component libraries provide **pre-built, reusable UI components**
that you can use instead of building everything from scratch.

They focus on **consistency, accessibility, and speed**.

---

## What Component Libraries are

A component library is a collection of:

- ready-made UI components
- consistent styling and behaviour
- built-in accessibility (sometimes)
- documented APIs

Examples of components:

- buttons
- inputs
- modals
- tabs
- dropdowns
- tables

You import and use them like normal React components.

## Styled vs Headless vs Utility-based libraries

### Styled component libraries

Provide:

- components **with styles included**
- predefined look and feel

Examples:

- MUI
- Ant Design
- Chakra UI
- Mantine

Pros:

- very fast to build UIs
- consistent design out of the box

Cons:

- harder to customise deeply
- design may feel “off-the-shelf”

---

### Headless component libraries

Provide:

- component **logic and accessibility**
- **no visual styles**

Examples:

- Radix UI
- Headless UI
- React Aria

Pros:

- full control over styling
- excellent accessibility
- great for custom design systems

Cons:

- more setup work
- slower initial development

---

### Utility-based component libraries (DaisyUI)

Utility-based libraries sit **on top of Tailwind**.

DaisyUI provides:

- pre-styled components
- implemented using Tailwind utility classes
- theme support via Tailwind

Example:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Click</button>
```

Pros:

- very fast development
- consistent styling
- works naturally with Tailwind

Cons:

- depends on Tailwind
- less control than fully custom components
- styles are opinionated

DaisyUI is popular for:

- dashboards
- internal tools
- MVPs
- rapid prototyping

---

## Why component libraries exist

Component libraries solve problems like:

- rebuilding the same components repeatedly
- inconsistent UI across the app
- accessibility mistakes
- slow development

They provide:

- tested components
- shared interaction patterns
- faster delivery

---

## When component libraries work well

Component libraries are a good fit when:

- consistency matters
- accessibility is important
- speed is a priority
- building internal tools or dashboards
- design does not need to be fully custom

---

## When component libraries are NOT ideal

They may be a bad fit when:

- branding is very specific
- pixel-perfect control is required
- bundle size is critical
- the library limits flexibility

Sometimes building your own components is better.

---

## Component Libraries vs Building Your Own

**Component libraries**

- faster to start
- less code to maintain
- accessibility often included
- limited flexibility

**Custom components**

- full design control
- tailored to your product
- more maintenance
- accessibility is your responsibility

---

## Common mistakes

- mixing multiple component libraries
- fighting the library’s design system
- over-customising instead of composing
- assuming all components are accessible
- ignoring bundle size impact

Choose **one approach** and commit to it.

---

## Mental model

- Styled library → design + behaviour
- Headless library → logic + accessibility
- Utility-based library → Tailwind + components

---

## Summary

- Component libraries provide reusable UI building blocks
- Styled, headless, and utility-based options exist
- DaisyUI is a Tailwind-based component library
- Great for fast, consistent UI development
- Can limit flexibility for custom designs
- Choose based on product needs, not trends
