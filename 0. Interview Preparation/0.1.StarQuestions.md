## PS: What is STAR?

STAR stands for:

### S → Situation

Describe the context.  
What was happening? Where were you working? What was the problem?

> Example:  
> “We had a production bug affecting payments after a recent release.”

---

### T → Task

Explain your responsibility.  
What were you expected to do? What was your role?

> Example:  
> “I was responsible for identifying the cause and fixing the issue quickly.”

---

### A → Action

Describe **what you actually did**.  
Focus on your decisions, steps, and reasoning. Avoid “we” where possible.

> Example:  
> “I checked logs, reproduced the issue locally, identified a race condition, and updated the state handling logic.”

---

### R → Result

Explain the outcome.  
What changed? What was the impact? What did you learn?

> Example:  
> “The fix reduced error rates to zero, prevented further customer impact, and we added monitoring to catch similar issues earlier.”
