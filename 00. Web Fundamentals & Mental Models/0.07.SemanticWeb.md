# 0.07 Semantic Web

The **Semantic Web** is about adding **meaning** to content,
not just structure or appearance.

It helps:

- browsers
- search engines
- assistive technologies
- machines (APIs, bots, AI)

understand **what your content means**, not just how it looks.

---

## Big idea

> HTML is for structure  
> CSS is for appearance  
> JavaScript is for behaviour  
> **Semantics is for meaning**

The Semantic Web builds on this idea.

---

## Semantic HTML vs Semantic Web

### Semantic HTML

- uses meaningful HTML elements
- focuses on **structure**

Example:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Blog post</h1>
  <p>Content</p>
</article>
```

This tells the browser:

> “This is an article with a heading and text.”

---

### Semantic Web

- adds **extra meaning and relationships**
- focuses on **data understanding**

It answers questions like:

- What is this content about?
- Is this a person, event, product, article?
- How are things related?

---

## Why the Semantic Web exists

Machines do not “understand” content visually.

Example:

```html
<p>Paris</p>
```

Is Paris:

- a city?
- a person?
- a movie?
- a brand?

The Semantic Web helps answer that.

---

## Structured data

The Semantic Web uses **structured data**.

Structured data:

- describes content in a machine-readable way
- adds context and meaning

Common format:

- **JSON-LD**

---

## Example: Article with meaning

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "headline": "How CSS Grid Works",
    "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Jane Doe"
    }
  }
</script>
```

This tells machines:

- this is an **Article**
- written by a **Person**
- with a **headline**

---

## Schema.org

**Schema.org** is a shared vocabulary for the Semantic Web.

It defines types like:

- `Article`
- `Person`
- `Product`
- `Event`
- `Course`
- `Organization`

Used by:

- Google
- Bing
- social platforms
- AI systems

---

## Why frontend developers should care

The Semantic Web affects:

- SEO (rich results)
- accessibility
- search previews
- content discoverability
- AI understanding of your site

You are already contributing to it when you write good HTML.

---

## Semantic Web vs SEO

SEO:

- helping search engines understand content
- ranking and visibility

Semantic Web:

- meaning
- relationships
- clarity of data

Good semantics → better SEO (as a side effect).

---

## Common tools & techniques

Frontend devs use:

- semantic HTML
- ARIA (carefully)
- JSON-LD
- meta tags
- Open Graph
- schema.org types

---

## Mental model

Think:

> “Can a machine understand **what this is** and **what it relates to**?”

If yes → you’re doing Semantic Web work.

---

## Summary

- Semantic Web = meaning + context
- Semantic HTML = foundation
- Structured data adds extra understanding
- Machines need meaning, not visuals
- Frontend developers play a key role
- Better semantics → better accessibility, SEO, and clarity
