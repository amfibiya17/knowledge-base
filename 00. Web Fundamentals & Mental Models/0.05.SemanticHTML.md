# 0.05 Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML means using **HTML elements that describe their meaning**,
not just their appearance.

It answers the question:

> “What _is_ this thing - not just how does it look?”

## What “semantic” means

**Semantic = meaningful**

A semantic element tells:

- the browser
- screen readers
- search engines
- other developers

**what the content represents**.

---

## Non-semantic vs semantic elements

### Non-semantic (no meaning)

```html
<div></div>
<span></span>
```

They tell you **nothing** about the content.

---

### Semantic (meaningful)

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<article></article>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
```

They describe the **role of the content**.

---

## Why semantic HTML matters

Semantic HTML improves:

- accessibility (screen readers)
- keyboard navigation
- SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
- maintainability
- correctness

CSS can change appearance.
Semantics define **structure and meaning**.

---

## Buttons vs divs

### Bad

```html
<div onclick="save()">Save</div>
```

Problems:

- not keyboard accessible
- no screen reader meaning
- requires JS + ARIA to fix

---

### Good

```html
<button>Save</button>
```

Benefits:

- keyboard support built in
- correct role announced
- correct behaviour by default

---

## Common semantic elements (what to use and when)

### Page structure

| Purpose      | Element    |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Page header  | `<header>` |
| Navigation   | `<nav>`    |
| Main content | `<main>`   |
| Footer       | `<footer>` |

---

### Content structure

| Purpose            | Element       |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Standalone content | `<article>`   |
| Thematic grouping  | `<section>`   |
| Side content       | `<aside>`     |
| Heading hierarchy  | `<h1>`–`<h6>` |

---

### Text content

| Purpose   | Element        |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Paragraph | `<p>`          |
| List      | `<ul>`, `<ol>` |
| List item | `<li>`         |
| Quote     | `<blockquote>` |
| Emphasis  | `<em>`         |
| Strong    | `<strong>`     |

---

## Headings

Headings create a **document outline**.

Rules:

- one `<h1>` per page (usually)
- do not skip levels
- structure > styling

```html
<h1>Page title</h1>
<h2>Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
```

Do **not** use headings for styling only.

---

## Forms and labels

Always associate labels with inputs.

### Bad

```html
<input type="email" placeholder="Email" />
```

---

### Good

```html
<label for="email">Email</label> <input id="email" type="email" />
```

This helps:

- screen readers
- larger click area
- accessibility

---

## Semantic HTML and accessibility

Semantic HTML gives you:

- correct ARIA roles automatically
- keyboard behaviour for free
- better screen reader output

Rule:

> If a semantic element exists, use it **before** adding ARIA.

---

## Semantic HTML in React

JSX is still HTML semantics.

Bad React is still bad HTML:

```jsx
<div onClick={save}>Save</div>
```

Good React is still good HTML:

```jsx
<button onClick={save}>Save</button>
```

Frameworks do **not** replace semantics.

---

## Mental model

Think of HTML as a **document**, not a canvas.

- HTML → meaning & structure
- CSS → appearance
- JS → behaviour

Get the meaning right first.

---

## Summary

- Semantic HTML describes meaning, not style
- Use correct elements for correct roles
- Improves accessibility, SEO, and clarity
- Reduces need for ARIA
- React does not change HTML rules
- Structure first, styling second
