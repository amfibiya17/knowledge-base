# 0.06 How the Web Works

The web is based on a simple idea:

> A **client** asks for something → a **server** responds.

Everything else builds on top of this.

---

## The two main players

### Client

- usually a **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- runs on the user’s device
- displays the UI
- runs HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Examples:

- your laptop browser
- your phone browser

---

### Server

- a computer somewhere on the internet
- stores data and code
- responds to requests
- sends back HTML, JSON, images, etc.

Examples:

- website servers
- APIs
- backend services

---

## The basic flow

1. User types a URL or clicks a link
2. Browser sends a request
3. Server processes the request
4. Server sends a response
5. Browser renders the page

This happens **very fast**, often in milliseconds.

---

## Step-by-step: loading a website

### 1. User enters a URL

Example:

```text
https://example.com
```

The browser figures out:

- protocol (`https`)
- domain (`example.com`)
- path (`/`)

---

### 2. DNS lookup (finding the server)

The browser asks:

> “What IP address belongs to example.com?”

DNS translates:

```text
example.com → 93.184.216.34
```

Now the browser knows **where** to send the request.

---

### 3. HTTP request

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

This request includes:

- method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- headers
- cookies (if any)

---

### 4. Server processes the request

The server:

- receives the request
- runs backend code
- fetches data (DB, API, files)
- prepares a response

---

### 5. HTTP response

The server sends back a response:

```http
200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
```

With content like:

- HTML
- JSON
- CSS
- JS
- images

---

### 6. Browser renders the page

The browser:

1. parses HTML
2. loads CSS
3. downloads JS
4. builds the DOM
5. paints pixels on the screen

This is called **rendering**.

---

## What happens after initial load

Once the page is loaded:

- JavaScript runs
- user clicks buttons
- browser sends **more requests**
- data updates dynamically

Modern apps do this a lot.

---

## APIs and data fetching

Frontend apps often request **data**, not pages.

Example:

```http
GET /api/books
```

Server responds with JSON:

```json
[{ "title": "Dune" }, { "title": "1984" }]
```

The browser:

- receives data
- updates the UI with JS

---

## Stateless nature of the web

HTTP is **stateless**.

This means:

- each request is independent
- the server does not remember you by default

State is handled via:

- cookies
- tokens
- sessions
- local storage

---

## HTTPS

HTTPS means:

- encrypted communication
- data cannot be easily intercepted
- identity of the server is verified

Modern browsers expect HTTPS.

---

## Mental model

Think:

```
Browser → Request → Server
Browser ← Response ← Server
```

Repeat forever.

---

## Why this matters for frontend devs

Understanding this helps with:

- debugging network issues
- performance optimisation
- SSR vs CSR
- APIs and data loading
- authentication flows

---

## Summary

- The web is client ↔ server communication
- Browsers request, servers respond
- HTTP is stateless
- HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP
- HTML/CSS/JS are delivered by the server
- APIs power modern dynamic apps
