# 0.01 Rendering vs State

This file explains the difference between **rendering** and **state** in frontend apps,
especially in React-like frameworks.

They are related, but **not the same thing**.

---

## What rendering is

**Rendering** means:

> Turning data into UI.

In practice:

- the UI structure is calculated
- React elements are created
- the UI is described based on current data

Example idea:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

Rendering answers:

- What should the UI look like **right now**?
- Based on the current data, what UI structure should exist?

---

## What state is

**State** is:

> Data that can change over time and affects the UI.

Example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

State represents:

- user input
- toggles (open / closed)
- fetched data
- current selection
- UI status

State answers:

- What data can change?
- What should trigger a UI update?

---

## How state and rendering are connected

State **does not change the UI directly**.

Instead:

1. State changes
2. Rendering runs again
3. UI updates to match the new state

Example:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
```

Flow:

```
State change → Re-render → Updated UI
```

---

## Re-rendering explained

Re-rendering means:

- the component function runs again
- React compares the previous render with the new render
- only the differences are updated in the DOM

Important:

> Re-rendering is **normal** and **expected**.

It does **not** mean the whole page reloads.

---

## What does NOT cause a re-render

These do **not** trigger a re-render by themselves:

- changing a normal variable
- mutating objects directly
- console logs
- DOM changes outside React

State changes, props changes, or parent/context changes can trigger a re-render.

---

## Mental model

- State → data
- Rendering → UI
- State changes → render runs again
- Render describes UI, framework updates DOM

---

## Summary

- Rendering = drawing UI from data
- State = data that can change
- State changes usually trigger re-rendering
- Rendering recalculates UI, not the whole page
