# 0.03 Hydration

Hydration explains **how a static HTML page becomes interactive**.

It answers the question:

> “If HTML already exists, why do we still need JavaScript?”

---

## The problem hydration solves

With **SSR or SSG**, the browser receives **ready-made HTML**.

That means:

- text is visible
- layout is rendered
- links look clickable

But… **nothing actually works yet**.

Buttons don’t respond.  
Forms don’t submit.  
State doesn’t update.

This is where hydration comes in.

## What hydration is

**Hydration** means:

- React runs in the browser
- React attaches event handlers
- React connects HTML to its component logic

After hydration, the app becomes **interactive**.

---

## How hydration works

1. Server sends HTML to the browser
2. Browser displays HTML immediately
3. JavaScript bundle downloads
4. React runs on the client
5. React matches components to existing HTML
6. Event handlers are attached

The HTML stays - React **takes over**.

---

## Why hydration is needed

Without hydration:

- SSR pages would be read-only
- interactions would not work
- React state would be missing

Hydration bridges:

> **Static HTML → Interactive React app**

---

## Mental model

**Rendering** → describing the UI

**Hydration** → attaching behaviour

Think of hydration like this:

- HTML = body
- JavaScript = brain
- Hydration = connecting the two

Without hydration, the body can’t move.

---

## Where hydration happens

Hydration happens in:

- SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- SSG (Static Site Generation)
- frameworks like Next.js

It usually does **not** apply to pure CSR pages,
because CSR builds everything in the browser.

---

## Summary

- Hydration makes HTML interactive
- React attaches behaviour to existing HTML
- Needed for SSR and SSG
- Rendering describes the UI
- Hydration activates it
- Without hydration, pages look alive but aren’t
