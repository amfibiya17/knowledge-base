# 0.02 Client vs Server Rendering

This file explains the difference between **client-side rendering**
and **server-side rendering**.

The key question is:

> **Where is the HTML created?**

---

## What “rendering” means

Rendering = producing the page UI (HTML is created either on the server or in the browser).

The difference is **who does it**:

- the **browser** (client)
- or the **server**

---

## Client-side rendering (CSR)

**Client-side rendering** means:

- the browser downloads JavaScript
- JavaScript creates the HTML
- the UI appears after JS runs

This is how **plain React** works by default.

---

### How CSR works

1. Browser loads a small HTML file
2. JavaScript bundle is downloaded
3. React runs in the browser
4. HTML is created dynamically
5. UI becomes visible and interactive

Example idea:

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

React fills this container **in the browser**.

---

### CSR characteristics

- initial page load can feel slower
- needs JavaScript to show content
- very interactive once loaded
- good for apps and dashboards

---

### When CSR is a good fit

CSR works well for:

- internal tools
- dashboards
- apps behind login
- highly interactive UIs
- SPAs (single-page applications)

SEO is usually **not critical** here.

---

## Server-side rendering (SSR)

**Server-side rendering** means:

- HTML is created on the server
- browser receives ready-to-use HTML
- JavaScript adds interactivity later

The UI appears **before** JS finishes loading.

---

### How SSR works

1. Browser requests a page
2. Server generates HTML
3. HTML is sent to the browser
4. Page is visible immediately
5. JavaScript loads and hydrates the page

---

### SSR characteristics

- faster first content display
- better for SEO
- works even on slow devices
- requires server logic

---

### When SSR is a good fit

SSR works well for:

- public pages
- content-heavy sites
- SEO-important pages
- user-specific pages
- pages with auth or cookies

## Key difference

| Question              | CSR (Client)    | SSR (Server)            |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Where HTML is created | Browser         | Server                  |
| First paint speed     | Slower          | Faster                  |
| SEO                   | Weak by default | Strong                  |
| JS required           | Yes             | Yes (for interactivity) |
| Interactivity         | After JS loads  | After hydration         |

---

## Important clarification

**SSR still uses JavaScript.**

Server rendering ≠ no JavaScript.

SSR only means:

> HTML is created earlier (on the server).

---

## Mental model

- CSR → “JS builds the page”
- SSR → “Server sends the page”
- Both → JS makes it interactive

---

## Summary

- Client rendering = HTML created in the browser
- Server rendering = HTML created on the server
- CSR is great for apps and dashboards
- SSR is great for public and SEO pages
- Both still rely on JavaScript
- Choosing depends on performance, UX, and SEO
