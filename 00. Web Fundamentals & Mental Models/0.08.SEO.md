# 0.08 SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)

SEO means **making your website easy for search engines to understand
and rank**.

It is about:

- clarity
- structure
- performance
- accessibility

---

## What SEO actually is

SEO helps search engines:

- find your pages
- understand your content
- decide when to show it in results

Search engines do **not** see your site like humans do.

They rely on:

- HTML structure
- links
- metadata
- performance signals
- semantics

---

## What SEO is NOT

SEO is **not**:

- stuffing keywords
- hiding text
- tricking Google
- magic rankings

Those things either:

- don’t work
- or will hurt your site

---

## How search engines work

1. **Crawl** - find pages via links
2. **Index** - store and analyse content
3. **Rank** - decide relevance and quality
4. **Serve results** - show to users

Frontend code affects **every step** (!)

## Frontend things that affect SEO

### 1. Semantic HTML

Search engines understand:

```html
<h1>Title</h1>
<article>
  <nav></nav>
</article>
```

Better than:

```html
<div class="title">
  <div class="content"></div>
</div>
```

---

### 2. Page titles & meta description

```html
<title>CSS Grid Guide</title>
<meta name="description" content="Learn CSS Grid with simple examples" />
```

These influence:

- search result titles
- click-through rate

---

### 3. Headings hierarchy

```html
<h1>Main topic</h1>
<h2>Subsection</h2>
<h3>Detail</h3>
```

Bad structure confuses search engines.

---

### 4. Links

```html
<a href="/blog/css-grid">CSS Grid</a>
```

Links:

- connect pages
- pass importance
- help discovery

Text matters more than `click here`.

---

### 5. Performance (Core Web Vitals)

Slow pages rank worse.

Important metrics:

- loading speed
- layout stability
- responsiveness

Frontend performance = SEO signal.

---

### 6. Accessibility

Accessible sites are:

- easier to crawl
- easier to understand
- more predictable

Good accessibility usually improves SEO.

---

## Mental model

Ask:

> “Can a search engine understand what this page is about even without running my JavaScript?”

If yes → good SEO foundation.

---

## Summary

- SEO = helping search engines understand your site
- It starts with HTML, not marketing tricks
- Semantic HTML, performance, and accessibility matter
- Frontend developers directly influence SEO
- Good SEO is usually good engineering (!)
